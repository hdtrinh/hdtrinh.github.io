Hi, I’m Hoang Duy Trinh! 

I'm an Assistant Researcher at the Mobile Network Department of the *Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya* (**CTTC**). I received the B.Sc. degree in **Information Engineering** and the M.Sc. in **Telecommunication Engineering** from the *University of Padova*, Italy, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. at the department of **Telematics Engineering** of the *Technical University of Catalonia* (UPC), Spain.

Since September 2016, I'm working as European Commission's Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow in the **EU H2020 MSCA SCAVENGE** (Sustainable Cellular Networks Harvesting Ambient Energy) project.

My current research interests are in the area of *Data Analytics, Machine Learning for Mobile Network, Wireless Communications and 5G.*
