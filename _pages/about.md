I'm a PhD in **Network Engineering** from the *Polytechnical University of Catalonia* ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en)), Barcelona, Spain. I've also received the BSc degree in **Information Engineering** and the MSc in **Telecommunication Engineering** from the *University of Padova*, Italy, in 2013 and in 2015, respectively. 

From September 2016 to September 2019, I worked as Research Assistant at the Mobile Network Department of the *Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya* ([CTTC](https://www.cttc.es)). In September 2016, I have been awarderd with a European Commission's Marie-Curie Fellowship to work as an Early-stage Researcher in the **EU H2020 MSCA SCAVENGE Project** (Sustainable Cellular Networks Harvesting Ambient Energy [SCAVENGE](http://www.scavenge.eu)).

My research interests are in the area of big data, machine learning, mobile networks, anomaly detection and 5G.

Starting from October 2020, I'm with **[Exein](https://www.exein.io/)** as Machine Learning Engineer, to build IoT Firmware Security solutions. Take a look at *[Exein's Medium](https://exein.medium.com/)* for more info.
