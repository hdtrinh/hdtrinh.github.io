I'm HD Trinh! 

I enjoy building ML things and playing with data. I am an **ML Engineer** at [Exein](https://exein.io/). Here, we develop secure and scalable systems for threat detection and anti-malware tools. 

I also have a PhD in **Network Engineering**  from UPC (Barcelona, Spain) and a M.Sc. in  **Telecommunication Engineering** from  UniPD (Padova, Italy). In 2016, I received a Marie-Curie Fellowship to work as a Researcher in the **EU H2020 MSCA SCAVENGE Project** (Sustainable Cellular Networks Harvesting Ambient Energy [SCAVENGE](http://www.scavenge.eu)).

Here you can found my published [research papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6D56zRAAAAAJ), [talks](https://hdtrinh.github.io/talks/), and my previous [experience](https://hdtrinh.github.io/cv/).
Follow me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdtrinh), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hd_trim) and [Github](https://github.com/hdtrinh) to see what I'm up to.

Cheers!
