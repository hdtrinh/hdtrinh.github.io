I've earned my Ph. D. in **Network Engineering**, graduating with honours from the *Polytechnical University of Catalonia* ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en)), Spain, in June 2020. Before, I received the B.Sc. degree in **Information Engineering** and the M.Sc. in **Telecommunication Engineering** from the *University of Padova*, Italy, in 2013 and in 2015, respectively. 

From September 2016 to September 2019, I've been working as Research Assistant at the Mobile Network Department of the *Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya* ([CTTC](https://www.cttc.es)). I've also have been awarderd with a European Commission's Marie-Curie Fellowship to work as an Early-stage Researcher in the **EU H2020 MSCA SCAVENGE Project** (Sustainable Cellular Networks Harvesting Ambient Energy [SCAVENGE](http://www.scavenge.eu)).

My current research interests are in the area of big data, machine learning applied to mobile networks, user-traffic forecasting, anomaly detection and 5G.
