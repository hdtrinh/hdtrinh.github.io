Hi, I’m Hoang Duy Trinh! 

I received the B.Sc. degree in Information Engineering and the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering from University of Padova, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Currently I am pursuing the Ph.D. with the Polytechnic University of Catalunya. In September 2016 I joined the Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya as a researcher for the SCAVENGE project, under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme. My research interests are in the areas of 5G, mobile big data and energy harvesting networks.
