Hello, I'm HD Trinh! 

I'm a passionate AI ML Engineer and Researcher. Currently, I'm working at [Intuition Machines, Inc](https://www.imachines.com/), where we develop solutions to stop bots and frauds.

I have experience in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Rust, Embedded Systems, and more.

I also hold a PhD in **Network Engineering**  from UPC (Barcelona, Spain) and a M.Sc. in  **Telecommunication Engineering** from  UniPD (Padova, Italy). In 2016, I received a Marie-Curie Fellowship to work as a Researcher in the **EU H2020 MSCA SCAVENGE Project** [SCAVENGE](http://www.scavenge.eu)).

Here you can found my published [research papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6D56zRAAAAAJ), [talks](https://hdtrinh.github.io/talks/), and my previous [experience](https://hdtrinh.github.io/cv/).
